        <code>
          During my time in college I participated alot in a society called Netsoc. 
          Here I originally joined as a sysadmin maintaining and managing multiple servers. During this time
          I gave numerous tech talks in topics ranging from "how to build a website" to "History of Telephone Hacking".
          In my final year in Netsoc, I got elected as the Events Officer and oversaw the organisation of over 50 events
          ran by the society.

        <code>
         Call Monitoring is a standalone phone call analytics software as a service. 
         Call Monitoring currently has 10+ actively paying customers using it daily. 
         Call monitoring started development as a small project back in late 2019, 
         and since then has been developed into a fully fledged software as a service product.
         This project went on to be the foundation of my Startup Quartx.

          <code>Streamlined Throughput prediction</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
        <code>
          This project was to investigate Continual Learning techniques for
          throughput prediction in relation to cellular networks. The goal was to accurately
          predict throughput using Continual learning techniques and determine
          if continual learning can provide promising advantages for throughput 
          prediction. This project questioned if continual learning will aid in
          dealing with throughput prediction in dynamic environments. Given that
          Continual learning is a state-of-the-art technique, this project examined
          and considered approaches in the design and implementation of a continual
          learning technique and decided on an effective approach fitting for this problem.

          SimpleTTS is a text-to-speech software written in python. It captures
          highlighted text on the screen and sends it to Google's text-to-speech engine, this
          sends back an mp3 file of the speech which then gets played using PyAudio.
          This project was built to aid myself with reading as I am dyslexic.
